# OEP_MCMC_NEMURObcp

This folder contains the code needed to perform an objective Markov Chain Monte Carlo ensemble parameterization of the NEMUROBCP model using field data from Lagrangian experiments conducted in the California Current Ecosystem, Gulf of Mexico, Costa Rica Dome, and Chatham Rise.  We refer to this as the objective ensemble parameterization using Markov Chain Monte Carlo or OEPMCMC approach.  
The run script is in the file OEP_MCMC_NEMURObcp.  A euphotic zone only version of NEMUROBCP (without additional submodules) is in NEMURObcp.m.  There are also multiple additional functions used for initialization, for implementing NEMUROBCP in a one-dimensional physical, and for computing the cost function relative to field data.  
For additional details, see Stukel et al. (“Quantifying biological carbon pump pathways with a data-constrained mechanistic model ensemble approach”).
